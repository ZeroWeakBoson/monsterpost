```liquid
1st layer:
It has a total of 1000 numbers
Total primes = π(1000) = 168 primes

2nd layer:
It will start by π(168)+1 as the 40th prime
It has 100x100 numbers or π(π(10000)) = 201 primes
Total cum primes = 168 + (201-40) = 168+161 = 329 primes

3rd layer:
Behave the same as 2nd layer which has a total of 329 primes
The primes will start by π(π(π(1000th prime)))+1 as the 40th prime
This 1000 primes will become 1000 numbers by 1st layer of the next level
Total of all primes = 329 + (329-40) = 329+289 = 618 = 619-1 = 619 primes - Δ1 
```

The 619 is the **114th prime**. It has the last index of 6 with the prime 19 where as **6x19** is also 114. When we multiply the 114 [minor hexagon](https://www.hexspin.com/minor-hexagons/) again by six (6) minus the duplicaton within those layers we got 684-30-30-5 = 684-65 which is also 619.

Despite the correlation between the bilateral 9 sums with the Fibonacci sequence, some people has discovered many things. The sequence of ***(55, 89, 144)*** shows an almost mystical power by its mysterious accuracy in nature and even _[in trading](https://www.tradingsim.com/day-trading/fibonacci-trading)_.
