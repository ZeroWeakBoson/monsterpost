* The direction of growth of the leading strand is 5′→3′. The direction of growth of the lagging strand is **3′→5′**.
* The formation of leading strand begins immediately at the beginning of replication. The formation of lagging strand **begins a bit later** than that of the leading strand.
* During the synthesis of leading strand, only one site of initiation is exposed in the template strand. During the synthesis of lagging strand, **multiple sites**  of initiation are exposed in the template strand.
