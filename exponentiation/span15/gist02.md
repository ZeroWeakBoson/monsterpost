## Electron scattering

Electron-electron scattering is described by one of the earliest published Feynman diagrams (featured in “Sightings,” September–October 2003). One electron (solid line at bottom right) shoots out a forcecarrying particle—a virtual photon (wavy line)—which then smacks into the second electron (solid line at bottom left). 

>The first electron recoils backward, while the second electron gets pushed off its original course. The diagram thus sketches a quantum-mechanical view of how particles with the same charge repel each other. As suggested by the term “Space-Time Approach” in the title of the article that accompanied this diagram, Feynman originally drew diagrams in which the dimensions were space and time; here the horizontal axis represents space.
