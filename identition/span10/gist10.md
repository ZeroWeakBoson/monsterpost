>In 1904 the French mathematician Henri Poincaré asked if the three dimensional sphere is characterized as the unique simply connected three manifold. This question, the Poincaré conjecture, was a special case of Thurston's geometrization conjecture. Perelman's proof tells us that every three manifold is built from a set of standard pieces, each with one of eight well-understood geometries _([Clay Institute](https://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems))_.

The Ricci Flow method has now been _[developed](http://engine.scichina.com/publisher/scp/journal/SCIS/62/9/10.1007/s11432-018-9702-7)_ not only in to geometric but also to the conversion of facial shapes in three (3) dimensions to computer data. A big leap in the field of AI ([Artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence)). No wonder now all the science leads to it.

>AI is one of the most debated subjects of today and there seems little common understanding concerning the differences and similarities of human intelligence and artificial intelligence. Discussions on many relevant topics, such as trustworthiness, explainability, and ethics are characterized by implicit anthropocentric and anthropomorphistic conceptions and, for instance, the pursuit of human-like intelligence as the golden standard for Artificial Intelligence _([Human vs AI](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frai.2021.622364/full))_.

Despite of any debated subjects regarding _Human vs AI_, the said AI would not even close to the ability of human brain without undertanding of _[GAP](https://gist.github.com/eq19/e9832026b5b78f694e4ad22c3eb6c3ef#mass-vs-gap-%CE%B4)_ functionality between left and right of the human brain. Let's find it in details on further discussion.
