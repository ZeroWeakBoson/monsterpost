There are, however, different editions of Azure AD licenses that provide the organization with different capabilities: Azure AD Free/Office 365, Premium P1, and Premium P2.

Though lower tiers of AAD have certain limitations, such as with the number of apps and directory objects IT teams can manage, Azure AD Premium P2’s feature set offers admins the opportunity to thoroughly manage their users and their SSO access.

### Azure AD

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is a cloud-based identity and access management service. Azure AD enables your employees access external resources, such as Microsoft 365, the Azure portal, and thousands of other SaaS applications.

>Azure Active Directory also helps them access internal resources like apps on your corporate intranet, and any cloud apps developed for your own organization _([Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis))_.

Azure AD [Premium P2](https://petri.com/azure-active-directory-premium-p1-vs-p2/#Active_Directory_Premium_P1_vs_P2_Which_plan_is_right_for_you) licenses are beneficial for organizations that are expected to demonstrate a high level of governance of identities. That implies managing privileged access and automating access reviews and responses to potentially compromised accounts.
